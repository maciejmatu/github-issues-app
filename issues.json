For Redux there is already Flow todos example - but **TypeScript example project** is **missing**, and you need to search it in alternative sources.\r\n\r\nSo I thought, might be nice idea to create todos also in TypeScript! üòè\r\n\r\nSub-project is based on Flow example, rewritten to typescript, added required typings and changed [React create app scripts to support typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).\r\n\r\nHope this might be good start for new guys adopting redux in TypeScript. And for experienced TypeScript devs to get always fresh ideas from this example (maintained by redux community).\r\n\r\nSoo.. what do you think?"

    "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**  \r\n\r\nRequest a feature\r\n\r\nHi there, I am working with an implementation of Redux for Android. The Kotlin library API is the same API as defined by the redux specs, no difference other than the language. I am having some problems with detecting specific Store events. Normally a component has only one interaction with the store, this is through the event onStoreChange(State currentState). With Presentational components there is no problem, because they only render the component props into the view. But, what happen if I have a Container component that needs to add/remove child components depending on a Store specific event.\r\nIn other words, the only information that a Store gives to a subscriber is the Store State itself, we can compare the previous state against the current state to determine the event that just happened, but its high performance. Another option to detect a specific event could be having an event map in the State and mark them with true/false as they happen. Then the subscribed component will check this map and act accordingly to the active event. \r\nHowever, I consider that the easiest way to inform a component about specific events in the State is to subscribe an StoreEventsListener object from the component, that will receive callbacks associated with specific Store events. \r\nIs this something that breaks the rules of redux?\r\n"

This works fine in, say, `mapDispatchToProps` (from `react-redux`) as it uses `store.dispatch`, but in `dispatch` calls in redux-thunk, the second argument disappears.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAll the arguments are passed to the dispatch:\r\n```javascript\r\n    var middlewareAPI = {\r\n      getState: store.getState,\r\n      dispatch: (...args) => dispatch(...args)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are ways to work around it (you can put all the arguments in an array or object), additional arguments can also be stripped by any middleware in middlewares chain, but still it would make things more consistent.\r\n\r\nIf it makes sense I can submit a PR."
